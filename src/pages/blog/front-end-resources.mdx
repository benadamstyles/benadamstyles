# Front End Resources

In terms of React and UI component design, these are some pages that I think give excellent advice:

- [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- [Writing Resilient Components](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/)

In terms of Design, off the top of my head this is as good as anything:

- [Refactoring UI](https://twitter.com/i/events/994601867987619840)

I'll put together a list of resources that have helped me and will keep this post updated.
